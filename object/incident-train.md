# Train Collision Accident: Possible Measures
### Comment on peer's submission

## Possible measures

The report demonstrates that it was possible to recreate the condition of the incident in a simulation. This discovery indicates poor testing, but poor testing can be traced back to poor requirement collection. A tester may never verify certain conditions if he/she is not aware of a requirement. As mentioned in the Investigation Report (2019), the development suffered a lack of specifications. In my essay for the LCS module, I reported several studies that attribute to poor requirements the main reasons for failure for a software project (e.g. Lobo & Arthur, 2005 as in Rossotto, 2021). It is advisable to have at least a formalized requirements log and use it as a base for the development of the test scenarios that will eventually verify the software.
