# Doctorâ€™s surgery - Reflections

I reviewed some of my peers' diagrams. It looks like I may have overcomplicated things trying to make the models more realistic. For this exercise, I kept it simpler. I did not introduce too many elements not explicitly mentioned in the text.

I maintained the style of the previous exercises, including the usage of colors, because it seems effective. I tried to draw elements in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow as much as possible. [The result](./doctors) is satisfactory.

I am not entirely happy with the sequence diagram. Modeling doctors and nurses as actors ended being a diagram full of actors with little space for the system.

Addendum after the seminar. I was surprised to see how these exercises are supposed to be done. I definitely overcomplicated everything, including this exercise, and I have to keep it in mind for the first assignment.
