# An object model to represent a supermarket

<img class="img-responsive" src="supermarket-2.vpd.png" alt="UML of an oline supermarket"/>

While doing the object [diagram for the supermarket](supermarket-object), I also improved [the original class diagram](supermarket).

Noticeably, I introduced colors to represent different domains, but I also replaced most of the compositions to simple associations being the composition a too strong relation in many cases.

I applied some of the recommendations in Ambler (2003) for class diagrams.
