# Mentoring session
Following a lecture about Information Risk Management, my submission was awarded a 1-to-1 mentoring session to discuss career prospects in Cyber Security or IT in general.

## The session

We analyzed my career.
* 17 years in software development
* Lots of diversity: big and small companies, different sectors, spread across different countries.

Next steps:
* Further specialize in a niche (e.g. Cybersecurity for AI)
* Become less dependent on a specific technology and address problems from a higher level
* Find my ideal customer or employer
* Is there anything that stops me? (e.g. financial limitations)

Actions to take:
* Write articles targetting my potential customer or employer: less technical and more "business"
* Invest time into networking: join conferences and seminars to meet people with common interests
