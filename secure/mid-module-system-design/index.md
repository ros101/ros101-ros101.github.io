# MyMONIT - Collecting measurements to monitor CERNâ€™s experiments

The document analyses the requirement of a monitoring application capable of aggregating measurements from different sources. The idea of the application stems from a real-world application that CERN developed to solve the same issue.

The analysis is the result of several weeks of progressive refinements to describe functional and non-functional requirements with special attention to the cybersecurity aspects.

All aspects mentioned in the document have been verified and tested to verify their feasibility.
