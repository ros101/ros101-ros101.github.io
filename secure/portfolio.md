# Guide to the Portfolio

I developed this portfolio organically with continuous updates dictated by the course's calendar. This guide summarises the activities, grouping them by the context to show the progress made during these months of work.

# Collaborative Discussion 1: UML flowchart

This was a three week discussion on the forum.

At [this link](../unit1) there are my initial post in Unit 1 followed by three questions and relative replies during Unit 2. In Unit 3, I merged all the material into [a summary post](../unit3/csrf-attack-summary) aiming to an organic presentation including all the points. Also from the summary post stemmed a question that is reported at the bottom together with my answer.
