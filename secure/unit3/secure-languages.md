# Secure languages

## What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?

From a survey (Fulton et al., 2021) and a study (Croft et al. 2022) it is possible to list concerns and desirable language characteristics

* memory safety
* concurrency safety
* issues related to data mutability
* null pointers
* type safety
* type checking

## Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.

Python offers some of the mentioned characteristics, but the lack of type checking leaves it vulnerable to programming errors. A language like offers most of the features, including a solution to deal with null pointers. Scala, also based on JVM, promotes immutability to strengthen concurrency safety.

## Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.

Assuming to be able to compile Python to achieve similar performances, Python may be a valid replacement for many components. I think that the lack of pointers may be an obstacle in the design of low-level components.
