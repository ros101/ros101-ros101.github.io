# Team work

During this course, I collaborated with four other students to realise a group assignment: the design and development of a monitoring system for CERN.

The collaboration was based on
- group meetings on Google Meet.
- group channel on Slack to easily chat.
- shared [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ros101/ssdcs-assignment)

We signed a [team contract](./TeamContract.pdf) based on a "no-pressure" policy.

The released analysis and the final implementation are available here:

- [Mid-module assignment&#58; MyMONIT - Collecting measurements to monitor CERN’s experiments - analysis](../mid-module-system-design)
- [End-module assignment&#58; MyMONIT - Collecting measurements to monitor CERN’s experiments - implementation](../end-module-system-design/)
