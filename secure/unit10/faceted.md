# Faceted Data

Essentially, the proposal of Schmitz et al. (2016) is a framework to separate concerns depending on the context. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a generic technique to separate concerns and weave them together into a coherent program (Elrad et al., 2001).

As defined in the popular AOP Java framework AspectJ (Kiczales et al., 1997), AOP consists in:
- Join points: execution points to be enhanced by a rule. Examples are methods (including getters and setters) and constructors, before or after the execution, or exception handling.
- Pointcuts: rule-based definition of join points. Examples are matching based on method signatures, return types or parameters.
- Aspects: a method-like logic that can be attached to a pointcut. They are implemented as static methods to be executed before, after, or "around" the pointcut.

AOP is a solution to program cross-cutting concerns such as logging, transactionality, and security. Its main advantage is to make these concerns transparent to the developer that can focus on the main business logic. Another advantage is that, with AOP, it becomes easy to centralize logic instead of duplicating it in several different components.

The main disadvantage of AOP is the lack of transparency for the developer. One of its advantages has a downside: the developer may not be aware of the injection of code that effectively modifies the flow and the outputs. That may be confusing and hard to debug.

The following is a simple implementation in Python. Join points are methods, decorators define pointcuts, and functions define the advice to be executed "around" the decorated method.

This implementation creates the decorator `@secure` switching the `Context` from `NORMAL` to `SAFE`. Methods decorated with `@secure` are not executed when the `Context` is `NORMAL`.

```python
class Faceted:
    """Class implementing decorator to block calls in unsafe contexts"""

    from enum import Enum

    class Context(Enum):
        """There can be two contexts: NORMAL (unsafe) and SAFE"""
        NORMAL = 'normal',
        SAFE = 'safe'

    @staticmethod
    def secure(func):
        """this decorator marks a function as 'secure'"""
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            # sets the context
            Faceted.secure_context = Faceted.Context.SAFE
            # run the original function
            func(*args, **kwargs)
            # restore the context
            Faceted.secure_context = Faceted.Context.NORMAL
        return inner

    @staticmethod
    def protect(func):
        """this decorator marks a getter as 'to be protected'"""
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            # if the context is not safe, return *** instead
            return func(*args, **kwargs) if Faceted.secure_context == Faceted.Context.SAFE else '***'
        return inner

class Data:
    """example of model"""

    def __init__(self, user:str, password:str) -> None:
        self._user = user
        self._password = password

    @property
    def user(self):
        """username, not protected"""
        return self._user

    @property
    @Faceted.protect
    def password(self):
        """password, this must not be printed"""
        return self._password


# creates a user with a robust password
data = Data('alberto', 'secret1!')

# this function is safe
@Faceted.secure
def process_user(data:Data):
    # this will show the password
    print(f'username: [{data.user}] password: [{data.password}]')

# this function is not safe
def log_user(data:Data):
    # the password will be hidden
    print(f'username: [{data.user}] password: [{data.password}]')

# demo it!
process_user(data)
log_user(data)
process_user(data)
```

The output is

```
username: [alberto] password: [secret1!]
username: [alberto] password: [***]
username: [alberto] password: [secret1!]
```

Important disclaimer: the solution above is not safe in a multithreading environment.

To properly address multithreading it is necessary to create a thread-dependent context that returns NORMAL/SAFE depending on the thread.
