Ontologies and UML class diagrams have semantic (similarities in vocabulary), conceptual (represented concepts), and schematic (connections between elements), and part of the differences can be attributed to the author of the diagrams (Mkhinini, et al. 2019). Many studies argues that the two representation are essentially the same with differences in conventions and assumptions (Atkinson & Kiko, 2005).
